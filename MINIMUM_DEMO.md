## ✍️ Summary

> This prototype lets me add chili crisps or hot sauces I own, assign a spice level, and verify that I submitted them using DAVE on Xion. It’s a public proof-of-concept for my spicy pantry.
> Entries include flavor and texture attributes like crispiness, garlic strength, and oil ratio — all verifiable using DAVE.

# Proof of Salsa ‚Äî Project Checkpoints & Key Information

## ‚úÖ Why this is valid for the hackathon

- You're using **XION's DAVE SDK** to build a mobile-first app in Expo/React Native.
- You're generating **zkTLS proofs** using **Reclaim** to verify salsa/chili crisp label info.
- You're writing **on-chain claim hashes** to **XION's testnet** (Cosmos SDK, gasless via Treasury).
- Your idea (spicy tasting log with verifiable entries) meets the hackathon theme: **"verified experience design."**
- The Notion brief specifically invites weird, delightful, and non-financial applications.

## üßæ .env.local ‚Äî What it does

This file stores your **environment variables** that connect your mobile app to:
- Your **Treasury contract** (used for gasless writes)
- The **RPC and REST endpoints** for the XION testnet
- Your **Reclaim App ID and Secret** (used for zkTLS flow)
- Your **Reclaim Provider ID** (used to verify a specific target string)

You do **not** commit this file to GitHub ‚Äî it's local only.

### Template

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase Zero Setup Checklist

- [ ] Join the Devpost hackathon and bookmark all pages
- [ ] Create your GitHub repo (e.g. `proof-of-scoville`, `crisp-proofs`, `veri-spice`)
- [ ] Install Node.js LTS and npm
- [ ] Install Expo CLI and confirm versions
- [ ] Install Android Studio or Xcode + simulator
- [ ] Install VS Code or preferred IDE
- [ ] Create an empty `.env.local` file to hold XION + Reclaim values

## üî• Naming Ideas

You're allowed to rebrand from "Proof of Salsa" as the theme evolves toward chili crisps, sauces, or heat.

Possible names:
- **Proof of Scoville** (most on-theme for verification + spice level)
- **VeriSpice**
- **ScovChain**
- **ChiliCheck**
- **MachaMatch**
- **HeatSig**
- **Chain Reaction** (if you want the double entendre)
- **ZKSpice**
- **Proof of Crisp**

We can lock this down once you decide if you're going chili crisp only, or a broader "hot things I love" flavor log.

## ‚úÖ Summary

You're building:
- A verifiable flavor tracking app that demonstrates zkTLS + on-chain proof without hype
- A beginner-friendly project that matches Devpost's theme and tone
- A playful but technically serious demonstration of the real-world potential of verifiable claims

You're good to go.

üî¨ Project Title:
Proof of Scoville

üå∂Ô∏è Tagline:
Verify the heat. One chili crisp at a time.

üìö Description:
A lightweight mobile proof-of-consumption prototype built using the Xion DAVE SDK, designed to track and verify personal encounters with spicy condiments ‚Äî from salsa macha to chili crisp. Bridging blockchain verification with everyday joy, this project explores low-stakes, high-flavor attestations as a playful spin on zero-knowledge proofs.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:

Xion DAVE SDK

React Native

Expo

@burnt-labs/abstraxion-react-native

Open source tools, with potential to fork for other ‚Äúproof-of-life‚Äù flavor logs

üë§ Built by:
A public-sector civic technologist moonlighting as a spice archivist.
